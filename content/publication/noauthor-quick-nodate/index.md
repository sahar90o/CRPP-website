abstract: Background: Microbubbles are widely used in diagnostic ultrasound applications as contrast agents. Recently, many studies have shown that microbubbles have 
good potential for the use in therapeutic applications such as drug and gene delivery 
and opening of blood- brain barrier locally and transiently. When microbubbles are 
located inside an elastic microvessel and activated by ultrasound, they oscillate and 
induce mechanical stresses on the vessel wall. However, the mechanical stresses have 
beneficial therapeutic effects, they may induce vessel damage if they are too high. 
Microstreaming-induced shear stress is one of the most important wall stresses. 
Objective: The overall aim of this study is to simulate the interaction between 
confined bubble inside an elastic microvessel and ultrasound field and investigate the 
effective parameters on microstreaming-induced shear stress.
Material and Methods: In this Simulation study, we conducted a 2D finite element simulation to study confined microbubble dynamics, also we investigated both 
acoustical and bubble material parameters on microbubble oscillation and wall stress. 
Results: Based on our results, for acoustic parameters in the range of therapeutic applications, the maximum shear stress was lower than 4 kPa. Shear stress was 
approximately independent from shell viscosity whereas it decreased by increasing 
the shell stiffness. Moreover, shear stress showed an increasing trend with acoustic 
pressure. 
Conclusion: Beside the acoustical parameters, bubble properties have important 
effects on bubble behavior so that the softer and larger bubbles are more appropriate 
for therapeutic application as they can decrease the required frequency and acoustic 
pressure while inducing the same biological effects.

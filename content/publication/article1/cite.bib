	abstract = {Background: Previous research studies have demonstrated that medical content image retrieval can play an important role by assisting dermatologists in skin lesion diagnosis. However, current state-of-the-art approaches have not been adopted in routine consultation, partly due to the lack of interpretability limiting trust by clinical users.
Objective: This study developed a new image retrieval architecture for polarized or dermoscopic imaging guided by interpretable saliency maps. This approach provides better feature extraction, leading to better quantitative retrieval performance as well as providing interpretability for an eventual real-world implementation.
Methods: Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) algorithms rely on the comparison of image features embedded by convolutional neural network (CNN) against a labeled data set. Saliency maps are computer vision–interpretable methods that highlight the most relevant regions for the prediction made by a neural network. By introducing a fine-tuning stage that includes saliency maps to guide feature extraction, the accuracy of image retrieval is optimized. We refer to this approach as saliency-enhanced CBIR (SE-CBIR). A reader study was designed at the University Hospital Zurich Dermatology Clinic to evaluate SE-CBIR’s retrieval accuracy as well as the impact of the participant’s confidence on the diagnosis.
Results: SE-CBIR improved the retrieval accuracy by 7\% (77\% vs 84\%) when doing single-lesion retrieval against traditional CBIR. The reader study showed an overall increase in classification accuracy of 22\% (62\% vs 84\%) when the participant is provided with SE-CBIR retrieved images. In addition, the overall confidence in the lesion’s diagnosis increased by 24\%. Finally, the use of SE-CBIR as a support tool helped the participants reduce the number of nonmelanoma lesions previously diagnosed as melanoma (overdiagnosis) by 53\%.
Conclusions: SE-CBIR presents better retrieval accuracy compared to traditional CBIR CNN-based approaches. Furthermore, we have shown how these support tools can help dermatologists and residents improve diagnosis accuracy and confidence.},

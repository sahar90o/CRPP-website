abstract: Background: Previous research studies have demonstrated that medical content image retrieval can play an important role by
assisting dermatologists in skin lesion diagnosis. However, current state-of-the-art approaches have not been adopted in routine
consultation, partly due to the lack of interpretability limiting trust by clinical users.
Objective: This study developed a new image retrieval architecture for polarized or dermoscopic imaging guided by interpretable
saliency maps. This approach provides better feature extraction, leading to better quantitative retrieval performance as well as
providing interpretability for an eventual real-world implementation.
Methods: Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) algorithms rely on the comparison of image features embedded by convolutional
neural network (CNN) against a labeled data set. Saliency maps are computer visionâ€“interpretable methods that highlight the
most relevant regions for the prediction made by a neural network. By introducing a fine-tuning stage that includes saliency

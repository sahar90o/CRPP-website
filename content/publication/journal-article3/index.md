abstract: We report lymph node involvement in oropharyngeal HNSCC on a patient-individual level. The dataset is made available together with an online interface to view and explore it at https://2021-oropharynx.lyprox.org. There, correlations between lymph node involvement and patient characteristics can be explored and the raw data downloaded. With its level of detail, our data may be the basis for further personalization of elective CTV definition.

abstract: Previous research studies have demonstrated that medical content image retrieval can play an important role by assisting dermatologists in skin lesion diagnosis. However, current state-of-the-art approaches have not been adopted in routine consultation, partly due to the lack of interpretability limiting trust by clinical users.This study developed a new image retrieval architecture for polarized or dermoscopic imaging guided by interpretable saliency maps. This approach provides better feature extraction, leading to better quantitative retrieval performance as well as providing 

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: In this article we proposed a content base image retrieval algorithm guided by saliency maps (SE-CBIR) which boots the retrieval accuracy by 7% compared to traditional approaches. In addition, a reader study shows that the use of such support tools help participants to improve their diagnosis accuracy while reducing melanoma overdiagnosis

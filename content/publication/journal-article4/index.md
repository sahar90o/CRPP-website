abstract: In this methodological paper we develop a hidden Markov model on the basis of our previously published Bayesian network model to learn and predict how SCC spreads through the lymphatic system. The new model intuitively includes T-category via the model's notion of time. It manages to accurately describe clinical data from our hospital while still having only a handful of highly interpretable parameters.

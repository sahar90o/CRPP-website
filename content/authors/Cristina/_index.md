During my scientific career, I have focused on the development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques for the assessment of tissue anatomy and function in a clinical setting. The evaluation of the sensitivity and of the specificity of MRI, as well as the MR-based assessment of quantitative physical variables that allow intra-subject and inter-subject comparison, have characterized my research activity of the last 15 years. The research experience as medical data analysist converged in a translational project aiming at developing and commercializing a computer aided diagnostic software for the early detection of breast cancer. The software (based on techniques of Artificial Intelligence) is commercialized as a certified medical device for the European Union and for the Swiss market from the USZ spin-off b-rayZ AG. I am co-founder and CEO of the company

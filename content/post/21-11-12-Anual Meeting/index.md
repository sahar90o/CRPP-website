This year, despite Covid-2019, we were lucky enough to hold our annual meeting, which took place over two days at the Hotel Hermitage Lucerne. All work package leaders and many junior researchers, 22 people in total, were able to attend the conference, where besides many interesting presentations a lively exchange between the different work packages took place.

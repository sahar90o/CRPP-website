For the second time we participated in Scientifica in Zurich in 2021. This time the theme was “natural-artificial” 
Our booth at Scientifica was used to (a) teach visitors the basics of machine learning (or artificial intelligence), and (b) to demonstrate the potential benefits of data analysis in imaging procedures for disease diagnosis, therapy decision-making, and prognosis estimation. In the didactic part (a) basic concepts of machine data analysis without going into complicated scientific and mathematical techniques. scientific and mathematical techniques. In part (b), the usefulness of machine analysis in disease diagnosis is presented. This was done by presenting various research projects within CRPP AIIN in imaging, such as the analysis of mammograms by means of artificial intelligence, the automated radiotherapy planning on the basis of a prediction of the lymph node metastasis by means of Bayesian networks or prognosis estimation by texture analysis ("radiomics") of CT or MR images of brain tumor patients. 
To activate visitors to these partially theoretical concepts, a hands-on demonstration of the problem was offered: Face mask recognition using Artificial Intelligence, a technology made topical by Covid-19.

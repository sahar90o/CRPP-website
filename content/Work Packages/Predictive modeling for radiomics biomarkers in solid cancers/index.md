Background
Cancer is a heterogeneous disease regarding etiology, pathogenesis, treatment response and prognosis. For optimizing treatment strategies on a patient individual level, identification of prognostic and predictive biomarkers is essential. Imaging biomarkers are of special interest as they provide spatial information and are acquired non-invasively. Radiomics is a large throughput method for quantification of medical images with comprehensive and quantitative analysis of areas involved by malignant cancer and regions of normal tissue. Such quantitative radiomic features have been shown as promising imaging biomarkers for prediction of overall survival or treatment response.

Our group has developed a fully DICOM compatible radiomic implementation, which has been standardized in a multicenter study. Using this implementation, we have shown that head and neck squamous cell cancer characterized by more heterogeneous CT density has a higher probability of local recurrence. Further analyses indicated that adding metabolic information from 18F-FDG PET did not improve the prediction model.
